Extending Relational Algebra

Group by aggregation
    part of so-called extended RA
    helps us to compute counts, sum, min, max, ...

    examples
        what is the average age of the customers?
        how many people bought an iPad?

    Notation: γ_(X, Agg(Y))R
        group by attributes in X
        aggregate the attribute in Y
            SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX
        output schema: X + an extra (numerical) attribute
    
    examples
        Person(ssn, name, age, phoneNumber)

        γ_avg(age)Person
        select avg(age) from Person;

        γ_(ssn, count(phoneNumber))Person
        select ssn, count(phoneNumber) from Person group by ssn;
