    Class Hierarchies

Roles in Relationship
    Label the edges to indicate the roles if an entity set plays more than one role.
    e.g. 
        In a table that stores employee info, there can be an additional 
        relationship between employees, for example supervisor-subordinates.

Participation Constraints
    Motivation
        e.g.: each department has at most one manager
        How to express the constraint that each department must have >=1 manager?
        - participation constraint

    Types
        Total participation
            Every entity participles at least one relationship
                - We use a thick line to represent a total participation
        Partial participation
            A participation that is not total is said to be partial
            i.e. there is some entities that do not participate in the 
                relationship specified.

    
Weak Entities
    A weak entity can be identified uniquely only by considering only by 
    considering some of its attributes in conjunction with the primary key of 
    another entity
        Owner entity set
        Weak entity set
    Restrictions
        Weak entity set must participate in one-to-many relationship set
        Weak entity set must have total participation
    Weak entity set and the associated relationship are drawn with dark lines.

Class Hierarchy
    Superclass: Product
    Subclass:   Software product, Educational product
    
    Notation: "ISA", which means 'is a', in a triangle
    
    e.g.
        option 1
            product(name, price, category)
            softwareProduct(name, price, category, version)
            educationalProduct(name, category, price, age-group)
        option 2
            product(name, price, category)
            softwareProduct(name, version)
            educationalProduct(name, age-group)
        option 3
            product(name, price, category, version, age-group)
            - use NULL to denote that the attribute makes no sense for a specific tuple
