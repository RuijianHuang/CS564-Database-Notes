SQL: Basic I
    Relational Model
        SQL: Basics 
            Creating a table
        SQL: Single-table queries
            SELECT-FROM-WHERE structure
            DISTINCT/ORDER BY/LIMIT

Definitions
    Database:
        A collection of one or more relations, where each relation is a table 
        with rows and columns
        Simple, elegant, and well-suited for efficient manipulations on 
        computers
    
    Relation:
        A table with rows and columns
    
    Row == tuple == record
    Column == attribute == field

    Domain:
        Each attribute has an specific type called domain
        E.g. integer, string, real
            PRODUCT(
                name: string,
                category: string,
                price: real,
                manufacturer: string)
    
    Schema
        The schema of a relation (table)
            - relation names + attribute names
            - Product(name, price, category, manufacturer)
        The schema of a database:
            - A collection of relation schemas

    Primary keys
        A primary key is a selected subset of attributes that is an unique 
        identifier of tuples in a relation.

Structured Query Language (SQL)
    API types
        DDL: Data Definition Language
            - Creation, deletion, modification of definitions of tables
        
        DML: Data Manipulation Language (DML)
            - Query
            - Insert, delete, and update rows
    
    Create a table
        CREATE TABLE <table_name> (
            <attribute 1> <attribute 1 domain> <optional ...>,
            <attribute 2> <attribute 2 domain> <optional ...>,
            <attribute 3> <attribute 3 domain> <optional ...>,
            <attribute 4> <attribute 4 domain> <optional ...>
        );
        
        Unique_keys
            CREATE ... (
                ... Primary key,
                name domain UNIQUE,
                ...
            );

    Insert to a table
        Insert a single tuple
            INSERT INTO <relation> VALUES 
                (<list of values>),
                (<list of values>),
                (<list of values>),
                (<list of values>),
                (<list of values>);

Basic SQL Query
    SELECT  [DISTINCT] attributes
    FROM    one or more tables
    WHERE   conditions on the tables
    
    * in SELECT: 
        select all attributes

    Renaming attributes: 
        SELECT <some attribute> AS <some other name for this attribute>

    Arithmetic Expressions
        E.g. SELECT sname, (60-age) AS YearToRetire FROM Sailors WHERE ...;

    WHERE clause operations
        Can use attribute names of relation that appear in the FROM clause
        Comparison operators:
            =, >, <, <=, >=, <> (not equal)
        Arithmetic operations:
            +, -, /, *
        Combine conditions:
            AND, OR, NOT
        Operations on strings: 
            Concatenation, etc.
        Pattern matching:
            LIKE
                % = any sequence of characters
                _ = any single character
            E.g.: ... LIKE '%something%'
        Special functions for comparing dates and times

    DISTINCT in SELECT
        Use DISTINCT in SELECT clause to removes duplicates

    ORDER BY 
        Orders the tuples by the attribute we specify in 
            DESC: decreasing
            ASC: increasing
        order.

    LIMIT <number>
        Limits the output to be a specified number of tuples
        Usually used with ORDER BY to get the top k records
