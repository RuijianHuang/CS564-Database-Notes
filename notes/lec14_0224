Division
    Notation: R1/R2
      - Suppose R1(A, B) and R2(B)
      - The output contains all values (a) such that for every tuple (b) in R2
        tuple (a, b) is in R1
      - Output schema: R(A)

    Analogy with integer division
        For integers A and B
            A/B is the largest integer Q such that Q × B <= A.
        For relation instances A and B
            A/B is the largest relation instance Q such that Q × B ⊆ A.

        Example
            Given A(x, y) and B(y)
                A/B = π_x(A) - π_x((π_x(A) × B) - A)

        
Relational algebra examples
    Example Database
        Sailors ( sid: integer, sname: string, rating: integer, age: real)
            Key: sid
        Boats ( bid: integer, bname: string, color: string)
            Key: bid
        Reserves ( sid: integer, bid: integer, day: date)
            Key: ( sid, bid, day )
