Database Design
  * Requirements Analysis
        Data stored, operations, apps, ...
  * Conceptual Database Design
        Model high-level description of the data, constraints, ER model
  * Logical Database Design
        Choose a DBMS and design a database schema
  * Schema Refinement
  * Physical Database Design
  * Application and Security Design

Entity-Relationship (ER) Model
    A visual language to specify
        what info the DB must hold
        what are the relationships among components of that info
    Proposed by Perter Chen in 1976
        relational model was proposed in 1969

ER Model Basics
    Entity
        distinguishable real-world object

    Entity Set
        a collection of similar entities
        all entities in an entity set have the same set of attributes
            (until we consider ISA hierarchies)
        represented by rectangles

    Attribute
        represented by ovals attached to an entity set

Entity Sets and Attributes
    - entities are not explicitly represented in E/R diagrams
    e.g.            (see figures in L7.pdf)
        r:product
            o:price
            o:name
            o:category
        r:company
            o:name
            o:stockprice
        r:person
            o:name
            o:address
            o:ssn

    Relationships
        company     makes   product
        person      buys    product
        company     employs person

Key Constraints
    types               notations:
        one-one             rec with 2 arrows
        many-one            rec with 1 arrow pointing one
        many-many           rec with 0 arrow

Descriptive Attribute in Relationships
    Record info about the relationship, rather than about any one of participating
    entities.
    e.g.
        Place where a Product is made by a Company.
        Date a Boat is reserved by a Sailor.
